# Artificial Evolution

## Project Overview
This study aims to develop an algorithmic approach for hill-climbers and genetic algorithms (GAs), and to investigate their performance by solving a very common combinational optimisation problem in NP, known as the knapsack problem. <br/>
I implemented a hill-climber, and a variety of different genetic algorithms i.e. spatial, steady-state, and microbial.<br/>
